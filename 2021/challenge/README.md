# Challenge
Solve each of the days in a different programming language.

The name of the programming language must start with the corresponding letter of the alphabet,
meaning A on day 1, B on day 2, etc.

As AoC is one day too short to go through the full alphabet, the letter R (Rust) gets skipped.
